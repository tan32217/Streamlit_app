Explanation of web app !!
In this project, I have conducted visualizations 📊 of apartments listed for rent in Los Angeles, as well as the number of bus 🚌 and metro 🚇 rail stops, and crime rates 🚨 for each locality displayed on maps. Utilizing Plotly charts, I have depicted the distribution of the number of bedrooms and bathrooms for the apartments.

Furthermore, I employed a heatmap 🔥 to comprehend the correlations between several features that were extracted. Additionally, through Seaborn's regplot function, I drew regression lines for various features such as rent vs. crime rate, rent vs. number of bus stops, and rent vs. number of metro stops.

To enhance user experience and analytical capabilities, I incorporated filters in the sidebar. These filters allow users to specify minimum and maximum rent values, select specific areas for crime analysis, and choose the number of bedrooms for correlation analysis of rent with other factors. 🛏️🔍
